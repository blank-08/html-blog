        <h2>Observing Black Holes</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our journey into the depths of the universe, where we'll explore one of the most mysterious phenomena known to humankind black holes. Buckle up as we delve into the fascinating world of these cosmic enigmas.</p>

                <h3>The Challenge of Observation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Black holes, by their very definition, are invisible. Their immense gravitational pull swallows everything, including light itself. So how do we observe the unobservable? Scientists have devised ingenious methods, primarily based on indirect observations, to detect the presence of these cosmic voids.

                            <h4>X-ray Emissions:</h4>
                            <p>Black holes, when actively feeding on surrounding matter, emit powerful X-ray radiation. By detecting these emissions, astronomers can pinpoint the presence of a black hole.</p>

                            <h4>Gravitational Lensing:</h4>
                            <p>The immense gravitational field of a black hole bends and distorts light from objects behind it. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, can reveal the presence of an otherwise invisible black hole by observing its effects on the light of distant stars and galaxies.</p>

                <p>
                    In <strong>April 2019</strong>, the <em>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration</em> made headlines by capturing the first-ever image of a black hole's event horizon. This groundbreaking achievement provided a glimpse into the heart of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, validating decades of theoretical predictions.
