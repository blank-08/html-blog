        <h2>Types of Black Holes</h2>
        <p>In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, black holes stand as some of the most captivating and enigmatic entities. These cosmic anomalies come in a diverse array of forms, each with its own distinctive properties and origins. From the remnants of massive stars to the monstrous gravitational behemoths lurking at the centers of galaxies, the taxonomy of black holes offers a fascinating glimpse into the intricacies of the universe's evolutionary landscape. Join us as we embark on a journey to explore the myriad types of black holes that populate the cosmic landscape, unveiling the secrets they hold and the mysteries they provoke.</p>

                <h3>Stellar Black Holes:</h3>
                <img src="../images/stellar.jpg" alt="Picture of stellar black holes" height="200" width="200">
                <p>Formed from the collapse of massive stars, stellar black holes are among the most common types found in the universe. With masses ranging from a few times that of the sun to several tens of solar masses, these black holes exert a powerful gravitational pull, devouring any nearby matter unfortunate enough to cross their path.</p>

                <h3>Intermediate-Mass Black Holes:</h3>
                <img src="../images/intermediate-mass.jpg" alt="Picture of intermediate-mass black holes" height="200" width="200">
                <p>Intermediate-mass black holes occupy the middle ground between stellar and supermassive black holes. With masses ranging from hundreds to thousands of times that of the sun, these enigmatic objects pose intriguing questions about their formation and evolution. Their existence hints at possible pathways for the growth of supermassive black holes through mergers and accretion.</p>

                <h3>Supermassive Black Holes:</h3>
                <img src="../images/super-massive.jpg" alt="Picture of supermassive black holes" height="200" width="200">
                <p>At the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, lie supermassive black holes with masses millions to billions of times that of the sun. These cosmic behemoths play a crucial role in galactic evolution, shaping the dynamics of their host galaxies through their gravitational influence and energetic outbursts.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Primordial Black Holes:</h3>
                <img src="../images/primordial.jpg" alt="Picture of primordial black holes" height="200" width="200">
                <p>Theoretical predictions suggest the existence of primordial black holes, which are hypothesized to have formed in the early universe from the gravitational collapse of dense regions. Unlike their stellar counterparts, primordial black holes could have a wide range of masses, from microscopic to supermassive, and their elusive nature presents a tantalizing target for future observational efforts.</p>

                <h3>Microscopic Black Holes:</h3>
                <img src="../images/mircoscopic.jpg" alt="Picture of microscopic black holes" height="200" width="200">
                <p>In some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, microscopic black holes could exist, with masses much smaller than those of stellar remnants. These hypothetical objects are thought to have formed in the extreme conditions of the early universe or through high-energy particle collisions in particle accelerators.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>The classification of black holes into various types reflects the rich diversity of the cosmos and the complex interplay of astrophysical processes that govern their formation and evolution. From the remnants of dead stars to the monstrous giants that lurk in the hearts of galaxies, black holes continue to captivate and challenge our understanding of the universe's most enigmatic phenomena.</p>
